## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've become a bit more proficient in using css properties like css flex box to create a responsive website. I also realized that it might be easier to design on mobile before desktop instead of doing the opposite like I did in the past.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
 ... 
}
```



### Continued development

I'll be moving on to more difficult challenges soon, to be honest I'm just getting started so I want to make sure I'm good at the simple skills first.
